# Game Minesweeper

---

## Project Overview

This project was created to practice C language skills and gain experience with OpenGL.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL

---

## Game Rules

The goal of the game is to uncover all the cells that do not contain mines. The player opens 
cells, trying not to open a cell with a mine. If a cell with a mine is opened, all mines are 
revealed and the game restarts. Mines are placed after the first move, so in newer versions, 
it is impossible to lose on the first move.

bigger and more interesting with OpenGL.
